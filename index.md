### About Me

I'm Siddhartha Srivastava. I graduted from IIT Kanpur with a degree in Mathematics in 2020. 

### This Website

I haven't really decided what I'll write here. Writing is one of the many things I'm not really good at, so hard for me to know what I'll write about until I've actually started writing.
