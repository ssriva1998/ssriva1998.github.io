Problem: Suppose you have an $$ n \times n $$ grid. Show that for any $$ 2n - 1 $$ points chosen on the grid, there exist $$ 3 $$ points that form a right-angle triangle.

Extension: Show that $$ 2n - 2 $$ points aren't sufficient to get an (axis-aligned) right-angle triangle. Is it sufficient to get any right-angle triangle (not necessarily axis-aligned)?
