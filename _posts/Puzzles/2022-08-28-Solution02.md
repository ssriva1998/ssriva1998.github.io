**Problem**: A cricketer has a strike rate of $$ 70 $$ in the middle of the match and raises it to $$ 80 $$ by the end.
Is it necessarily true that it was exactly $$ 75 $$ at some point? Why or why not?

**Solution**: T 


**Extension**: Show that $$ 2n - 2 $$ points aren't sufficient to get an (axis-aligned) right-angle triangle. Is it sufficient to get any right-angle triangle (not necessarily axis-aligned)?

**Solution (Extension)**: If the grid is $$ [1,n] \times [1,n] $$, consider the $$ 2n - 2 $$ points $$ (1,1), (1,2), \dots, (1,n-2), (1,n-1), (2,n), (3,n), \dots, (n-1,n), (n,n) $$. We see that no right-angle triangle can be made (even non axis aligned).
