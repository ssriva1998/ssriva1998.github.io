**Problem**: A basketball player has a season free throw average of $$ 70\% $$ halfway through the season, and raises it to $$ 80\% $$ by the end of the season.

Is it necessarily true that it was exactly $$ 75\% $$ at some point? Why or why not? [Source](https://twitter.com/TaterTotient/status/1563246271884042253)

**Extension**: For which integer triples $$ (a,b,c) $$ can a basketball player go from a free throw average of $$ a $$ to $$ c $$ while avoiding a free throw average of $$ b $$.
