**Problem**: A cricketer has a strike rate of $$ 70 $$ in the middle of the match and raises it to $$ 80 $$ by the end.

Is it necessarily true that it was exactly $$ 75 $$ at some point? Why or why not?

**Extension**: For which integer triples $$ (a,b,c) $$ can a cricketer go from a strike rate of $$ a $$ to $$ c $$ while always crossing a strike rate $$ b $$.
