<p><strong>Problem</strong>: A basketball player has a season free throw average of \(70\%\) halfway through the season, and raises it to \(80\%\) by the end of the season.
Is it necessarily true that it was exactly \(75\%\) at some point? Why or why not?</p>

<p><strong>Solution</strong>:  Let \((70\%, x_1, \dots, x_n, 80 \%)\) be the free throw averages after every free throw starting from the seasonâ€™s halfway mark until the end of the season.</p>

<p>Now suppose that at no point in time was the free throw average \(75 \%\). We know that there must exist some \(i\) such that \(x_i &lt; 75\% &lt; x_{i+1}\). Suppose that the number of free throws taken at point \(i\) is \(n_i\) and the number of successful throws taken are \(s_i\). Additionally, as the free throw average increases, we know that the free throw taken after the \(i\)th point must have been successful. Therefore,</p>

\[x_i = \frac{s_i}{n_i} &lt; \frac{3}{4} \text{ and } x_{i+1} = \frac{s_i + 1}{n_i + 1} &gt; \frac{3}{4}\]

\[4s_i &lt; 3n_i \text{ and } 4s_i + 4 &gt; 3n_i + 3\]

\[4s_i &lt; 3n_i \text{ and } 4s_i + 1 &gt; 3n_i\]

<p>This is not possible for natural numbers \(s_i\) and \(n_i\) which leads to a contradiction.</p>

<p>Therefore, the basketball player must always reach a point where their free throw average is \(75\%\).</p>

<p><strong>Extension</strong>: For which integer triples \((a,b,c)\) can a basketball player go from a free throw average of \(a\) to \(c\) while avoiding a free throw average of \(b\).</p>

<p><strong>Solution (Extension)</strong>: First we look at the case where \(a &lt; c\). Looking at the previous proof, we note that all \(b\) such that \(b = n/(n+1)\) for some natural number \(n\) are unavoidable. To prove that they are the only unavoidable numbers, suppose \(b = p/q\) where \(p + 1 \not = q\). Using the same logic previously</p>

\[qs_i &lt; pn_i \text{ and } qs_i + (p-q) &gt; pn_i\]

<p>If we have \(pn_i = qs_i + 1\), we see that both equations are satsified. We know that it is always possible to find \(n_i\) and \(s_i\) such that this equation holds. To see this, note that since \(p\) and \(q\) are co-prime, there exist multiple \(n_i\) such that \(pn_i \equiv 1 \pmod{q}\). Therefore, \(pn_i = qs_i + 1\). Therefore, to avoid \(b\), we note that we can first aim to reach \(n_i\) shots with \(s_i\) successful ones while making sure that all required successful shots happen at the end (to avoid crossing \(b\) before). Then we shoot one successful free throw to get to \((s_i + 1)/(n_i + 1) &gt; b\) after which you can reach \(c\) by frontloading successful shots.</p>
