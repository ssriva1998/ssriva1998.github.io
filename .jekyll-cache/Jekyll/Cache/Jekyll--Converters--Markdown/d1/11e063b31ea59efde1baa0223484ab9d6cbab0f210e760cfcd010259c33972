I"ï<p>One of the more unfortunate aspects of IIT Kanpur culture has been the fact that most discussions around career take place based on vibes and anecdotes. You rarely see hard data on what the outcomes of certain activities are on your career. This has been on the back of my mind until I noticed this tweet.</p>

<div class="jekyll-twitter-plugin"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Before my ICPC team (Butterroti, <a href="https://twitter.com/avaitopiper?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@avaitopiper</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/SureYeaah?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SureYeaah</a>), there were no Div-1 CF coders in my college<br /><br />IIT Patna had also never made it to ICPC World Finals<br /><br />Since we made it to World Finals 5/6 years between 2018-23<br /><br />Now we have 25 Div-1 coders (37 by max rating), and 1 is Red</p>&mdash; Prateek (@weights_theif) <a href="https://twitter.com/weights_theif/status/1768183586912411732?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2024</a></blockquote>

<p>Similar to the tweet, I decided to see how many people from IIT Kanpur have a max rating 1900. Running a small script, I found there were roughly 98 people. (The fact that some people create alts and some people don‚Äôt put their college means that getting an exact count is)</p>

<p>Gathering more data on 98 people is a lot to analyse, so I decided to look at a smaller subset (max rating above 2100). This turned out to be roughly 38 people, who I‚Äôve listed below</p>

<div class="sheetiframe-container">
    <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vRrvBibr6eSwRVV3ntSte_ENA9oYbD7zw8dlRQXNTXD0O6p-KtOc5BqqLN-nBKugQ/pubhtml?gid=1292932476&amp;single=true&amp;widget=true&amp;headers=false" class="sheetiframe"></iframe>

<p>The one interesting thing is that almost everyone is at a company that comes on day 1 of placements. A majority are from CSE (19), Math (6) and Electrical (3) but there are a few from Civil (2) which is surprising. A good chunk of people working full time are at either Glean, Rubrik or Google. For those that are still in college, most have internships at trading firms.</p>

<p>I think the larger interesting point is that almost everyone who hits 2100 at any point of time does really well and arguably, there‚Äôs a higher probability of a non CSE &gt;2100 rated coder getting into a top company than the average non &gt;2100 rated CSE student.</p>

<p>It would be unfair to not discuss the few obvious flaws in this discussion.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The data is skewed towards recent graduates - due to rating inflation, it‚Äôs easier to hit 2100 now than it was 5 years ago. Codeforces is also relatively new, so lots of older alumnus didn‚Äôt use Codeforces. This means that we‚Äôre essentially analysing early career data. Only 5-6 people in this list graduated before 2020.</li>
  <li>Competitive programming is essentially ‚Äúteaching the test‚Äù - most companies have tests where you have an advantage if you‚Äôve done competitive programming. This means that it‚Äôs relatively easy to break in early on, but it may not be a predictor of future success.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the data, it‚Äôs clear that hitting 2100 on Codeforces helps a lot with job prospects (even more than being in CSE), even though for getting IIT CSE is a significantly tougher task than hitting 2100 on Codeforces.</p>

<p>The relatively small script to pull names.</p>
